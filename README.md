The first page contains the frequency of crimes in descending order. Right-click any of the crimes and click drill through. This will lead to another report that contains information about which area has the highest crime, which time it is most likely to occur, at which locations within that area it is more likely to happen and what which premise. Level of granularity is this  **Area name -> Location -> Premise**.
